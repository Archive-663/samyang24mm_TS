### Background Story:
I've been looking for an affordable Tilt Shift lens for my GFX50s. This one fit the bill at $200 used on eBay. Yes, eventually I will pick up a Laowa shift lens, but for now this was an easy way to step into it with my GFX. Curiosity got the better of me and I adapted it to my Bronica S2A as a way to have a cheap ultra wide angle lens. Unfortunately it does not fully cover the 56mm x 56mm frame. I think it's useable as it's only extreme corner vignetting.
