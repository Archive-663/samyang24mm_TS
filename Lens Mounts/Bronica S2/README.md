![productShot001](https://github.com/Archive-663/samyang24mm_TS/blob/main/ASSETS/PHOTO/PRODUCT/1%20(3).jpg)

### Features:
- Ultra wide angle FOV
- 12mm FF equivalent FOV
- Fast equivalent f1.5 aperture

### What you'll need:
- 6x M1.6 x 5mm pan head machine or self tapping screws
- 4x original screws from the tilt shift lens

### What would be helpful:
- M1.4 drill bit for tapping M1.6 screw holes
- M1.6 tap

### Printing help:
Filament recommendation:
- ABS
- PETG

Generally, all my designs have chamfers on the print face of the STL. You can reference the supplied 'printOrientation' .3mf files for suggested print orientation.

### Assembly help:
Drill holes to their correct tap size before tapping.
- M1.6 tap require M1.4 bore.

Remove the mount and tilt/shift assemblies from the lens and replace it with the two stacked rings.

Please view the _assembly.stp file for help in parts orientation. If you do not have a CAD program, download FreeCAD to view the assembly file and better understand how it should assemble.
